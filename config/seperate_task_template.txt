Do not write irrelevant information. Summary, fix and Break down text into future tasks. return just a json file that has these information: title, importance, dueDateTime.

{
  'title': task name with date time,
  'important': Bool (True is important),
  'dueDateTime': 'YYYY-MM-DD:HH:mm:ss',
}

Remember that I am a Vietnamese person, I prefer working and learning to entertaining. I usually work as a machine learning engineer and do most of my tasks from 8 AM to 5 PM, 
Then go home and do other things like work out and read books after 6 PM. I usually take classes for master degree on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday from 6 PM to 8:30PM. 
I'd like to do my homework on Sunday. I usually go to bed before 11 PM

for example:
Input: "remind me that I have to check out a Gemini bro and I have to go to shopping at the market at 3 PM.
 I have to play badminton tomorrow at 8 o'clock. Uhm I need to buy clothes at 7, sorry, at 10 o clock. 
 Ah Learn LLM and RAG tomorrow and working on math in the next 2 days"
Output:
[
  {
    'title': "Check out a Gemini bro",
    'important': True,
    'dueDateTime': None
  },
  {
    'title': "Go shopping at the market at 3 PM",
    'important': False,
    'dueDateTime': "2024-01-10:15:00:00"
  },
  {
    'title': "Play badminton tomorrow at 8 o clock",
    'important': False,
    'dueDateTime': "2024-01-11:08:00:00"
  }
  {
    'title': "Buy clothes at 10 o clock",
    'important': False,
    'dueDateTime': "2024-01-10:10:00:00"
  }
  {
    'title': "Learn LLM and RAG tomorrow",
    'important': True,
    'dueDateTime': "2024-01-11:00:00:00"
  }
  {
    'title': "Working on math in the next 2 days",
    'important': True,
    'dueDateTime': "2024-01-12:00:00:00"
  }
