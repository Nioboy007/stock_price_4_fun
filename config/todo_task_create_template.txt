Do not write irrelevant information. Summary, fix and Break down text into tasks. return just a json file that has these information: title, importance, dueDateTime, body like this. 
Remember that I prefer working and learning to entertaining. I usually work from 8 AM to 5 PM, Then go home and entertain after 6 PM
{'title': task,
'important': Bool (True is important),
'dueDateTime': 'YYYY-MM-DD:HH:mm:ss',
}
for example:
Input: "remind me that I have to check out a Gemini bro and I have to go to shopping at the market at 3 PM. I have to play badminton tomorrow at 8 o'clock"
Output:
[
  {
    'title': "Check out a Gemini bro",
    'important': False,
    'dueDateTime': None
  },
  {
    'title': "Go shopping at the market at 3 PM",
    'important': False,
    'dueDateTime': "2024-01-10:15:00:00"
  },
  {
    'title': "Play badminton tomorrow at 8 o clock",
    'important': True,
    'dueDateTime': "2024-01-10:08:00:00"
  }
]
